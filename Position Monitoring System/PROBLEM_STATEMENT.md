# Problem Statement

In many applications like robotics, drones, and motion tracking systems, real-time position monitoring is critical. This project aims to solve the problem of monitoring an object's orientation in 3D space using low-cost components. The system will read real-time data from an IMU (MPU6050), calculate position (roll, pitch, yaw), and display it on an OLED.
