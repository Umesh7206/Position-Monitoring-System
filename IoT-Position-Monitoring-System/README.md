# Industrial IoT: Position Monitoring System

This project is a simulation-based Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) solution that monitors the position and orientation of an object using an ESP32 microcontroller, MPU6050 sensor, and OLED display. The motion data is also uploaded to the cloud using ThingSpeak for remote monitoring.
